0080 [0..7]
[0..3]
Distance from putter to hole before shot
 -vertical distance only
 -calculated from hole size and/or pixel distance away
  -calculated from single camera frame when button is first triggered on putter
 -units don't matter as long as everything is the same units
 -should be a positive float

[4..7]
Offset of hole from center line before shot
 -horizontal distance from center of camera frame to center of hole
 -calculated from same camera frame as above distance
 -should be zero if on center line, positive if to the right, negative if to the left
 -should be a signed float

0081 [0..19]
[0..3]
Horizontal distance between ball and hole after shot
 -calculated from center of ball to center of hole
  -calculated from single camera frame after both putter and ball stop moving
 -calculate as (ball distance from left edge - hole distance from left edge)
  -should be positive if ball is to the right of hole
 -should be zero if ball is in hole
 -should be a signed float

[4..7]
Vertical distance between ball and hole after shot
 -calculated similar to above
 -should be positive if ball is above hole, negative if below
 -horizontal and vertical distance should both be zero if ball is in hole
 -should be a signed float

[8..11]
Force of swing
 -calculated as max force input from force sensor during swing?
 -should be zero if it is a practice swing (if below a certain threshold zero it)
 -should be a positive float

[12..15]
Angle of putter
 -angle putter makes with the ground before swing
 -calculated as a degrees between vertical and putter angle
 -should be calculated with IMU accelerometer data
  -it may be necessary to know at what angle the IMU will be attached to the putter (idk)
 -may be unnecessary to include as data
 -should be a positive float

[16..19]
Degree of follow-through
 -angle putter makes at the peak of its swing after hitting the ball
 -should be calculated with IMU accelerometer/gyroscope data
 -calculated as degrees between vertical and peak putter angle
  -probably necessary to calculate angle of putter pre-swing
 -should be a positive float

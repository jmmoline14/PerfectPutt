Sensors (Joseph Moline)

1. IMU (dead reckoning)
https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/TDK-InvenSense/EV_ICM-20948?qs=u4fy%2FsgLU9Oeg9AkcS2y3A%3D%3D&mgh=1&srsltid=AfmBOoqSnmx5EifQ9Urh8UicyCTeBAsAwsUmUA4fLO7cPdMqIrrcgo1heII
This IMU will allow for us to do our dead reckoning with minimum drift and is cost effective for an IMU

2. Input sensor to start/stop dead reckoning process
https://www.adafruit.com/product/492
This will allow our user to easily pass input into the microcontroller locally on the device

3. Pressure/Force sensor to measure the actual swing

This product will best help us determine force that has impacted the golf club

4. Camera for eventual image processing
Portenta H7 Machine Vision

(THIS FOR NOW BUT ONCE WE DECIDE ON A BOARD I'LL PROBABLY GET ONE SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT BOARD)


Microprocessor:
ESP32
(Potentially Arduino/ESP32 (to Decide))
